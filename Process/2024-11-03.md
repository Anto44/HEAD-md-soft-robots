# SCENARIO FOR THE BOOKSHELF MANAGER
I am trying to allow a day by themes I have highlight. For today it will be the idea of the guiding book

## The Bookshelf Manager
A soft robot helping you dealing with your library

### Concept
Working as a book finder, this robot helps you to pick a book out of a bookshelf and take a moment to read it.

### Where does it exist ?
On a bookshelf. 

### For who is it ?
For people having a bookshelf at home that never take the time to read their books

### How does it work ?
The idea is for the robot to be on a mobile axis along the length of the library and to be able to lower elements as paper or rope to the level of the different books. This would highlight certain books that are all too often overlooked. 

### How does the user interact with the robots ?
It can play with the robot by changing the position of the pointing tool.
