# Question

How to catch the passage of someone and record it as an archive of livinghood ?

# Intro
Based on discussion with laure, going to the ceiling as a witness recording what is under by catching object seems to be difficult. Even if the robots is on the ground and catch things randomly to trap them and sealed them as a vaccuum would do. 
That is why I decided to focus more on this idea of catching things involuntarily  as the robots help in this process.

So it is about :

- Identifying system that can open and close to trap things
- Identifying what kinds of object that can represent our passage as a symbol of our presence
- Find a way to record a footrprint of this passage (print methodology)

# Opening and closing system in nature

## Clams and Oysters: 
Bivalves like clams and oysters have two-part shells that they can tightly close to protect their soft bodies inside. They use a strong muscle called the adductor muscle to keep the shell shut when threatened.

## Turtles and Tortoises: 
These reptiles have a bony shell that protects their bodies. Some turtle species can pull their head, legs, and tail completely inside the shell, closing off access to predators.

## Armadillos: 
When threatened, certain species of armadillos can curl up into a ball, closing off vulnerable parts of their bodies. Their tough, armored plates act as a protective shell.

## Pill Bugs (Roly-Polies): 
Pill bugs, also known as woodlice, can roll into a tight ball when threatened, closing off access to their softer underbodies. This behavior is a defense mechanism that protects them from predators.

## Box Turtles: 
Unlike other turtles, box turtles have a hinge on the bottom of their shell (the plastron) that allows them to completely close up. They can tuck in their limbs and head, and the hinged shell closes tightly to keep them safe.

## Trapdoor Spiders: 
While not a true shell, trapdoor spiders build burrows with a hinged door that they can quickly close to avoid predators. They use silk and soil to create a door that blends into their environment, which they can snap shut for protection.

## Mollusks (Snails): 
Many snails have a coiled shell that they can retreat into, sealing off the opening with a structure called an operculum, which acts like a door to close the shell tightly.

## Horseshoe Crabs: 
The hard shell of horseshoe crabs acts as a protective exoskeleton. When they’re flipped upside down, they tuck in their legs and use their shell as a barrier against predators.

## Boxfish: 
Some species of boxfish have bony plates covering their bodies, forming a rigid box-like shell. They can use their hard structure as a defense mechanism, though they don’t "close" it in the same way as others on this list.

# Identifying things that represent our passage everyday

## Things we supposedly remove or put on everytime we pass by

- keys
- bags
- rings
- jewelry
- Water Bottle or Coffee Mug
- Shoes or Slippers
- Book, Journal, or Notebook
- Headphones or Earbuds
- Phone devices related
- Glasses or Sunglasses
- Laundry Pile or Towel

# Exploring trap for catching daily routine by ai

## 1. The Doorway Ground Trap
Purpose: Capture patterns of movement or items you tend to drop near the door.

### Setup: Place a large piece of paper, fabric, or even a tray on the floor just inside the door.
Usage:
Every time you enter, consciously or unconsciously leave items like shoes, bags, or even dirt from your shoes on this surface.
Note patterns over time. Are there items you always drop in the same spot? Do you step in a particular place repeatedly?
Visual Archive: Take daily photos of the trap at the same time to document changes.

## 2. Key-Mark Sheet
Purpose: Understand how consistent (or inconsistent) you are with where you place your keys.

### Setup:
Place a clean white sheet of paper, a corkboard, or a pre-marked sheet near your designated "key spot."
Use small stickers, pencil marks, or ink stamps each time you place your keys down.

### Observation:
Over time, patterns will emerge: Do you always place keys in the same spot, or is it random? Does your habit change depending on stress or busyness?

### Reflection: 
Write a short note alongside your observations, such as "I was in a rush today, left keys far from usual spot."

## 3. Shadow Detector for Small Items
Purpose: See what objects you regularly interact with.

### Setup:
Use a piece of light-colored cardboard or paper on a table where you often drop smaller items (keys, phone, wallet).
Trace the outlines of objects each time you leave them there, creating a “shadow” of your habits.

### Result: 
Over time, the sheet will turn into a map of your daily essentials and reflect changes in routine or the significance of certain objects.

## 4. Invisible Footprint Tracker
Purpose: Track unnoticed routines.

### Setup:
Sprinkle a fine layer of flour, sand, or chalk dust lightly on a piece of dark paper near the door or a regular pathway.
Each time you walk past, your footsteps will leave an imprint.

### Observation:
See where you naturally gravitate when entering or exiting. Clean it up and repeat over a few days for a bigger picture.
Twist: Use this method to detect "absences"—areas where you never step.

## 5. Memory Clues
Key Tray with Daily Notes:
Place a small notepad near your key spot and jot a quick word or sentence each time you set down your keys (e.g., how you’re feeling, what you just did).
Over time, this will create a mental map tied to your key placement habits.
