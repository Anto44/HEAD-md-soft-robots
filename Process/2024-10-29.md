# SCENARIO
I am trying to allow a day by themes I have highlight. For today it will be the idea of distributor 

### Idea 1. The surprise
Creating a soft robot troubling the daily routine with an installation displaying some words/sentence/picture on the floor. Working as a surprise box being fixed to the ceiling, you never know when the present will fall down to you. It could be imagined as an advent calendar or a fortune cookie distributor.
This soft robots can move on an axis allowing it to display things around.
capsule-like

## Context
I want to create a soft robot habiting the domestic ceiling, a mechanism that interact the room and whats under it (object). The robot can slide along an axis through the room. The input can be based of a random timeline (twice a day/ a week). I have three idea :
- A personal emergency to warn yourself from something
- A unexpected event to trigger you about the routine
- A guiding system to force you to take the time to do something specific
The system can play with what is under it (as an object) or not (poetical)

### Must-have
- It belong to a domestic place as a home (any room)
- It has to be fixed to the ceiling but nothing fixed from the ground so it can move along the ceiling
- it has to work as a distributor so somehting going out of the robots
- It has to be made out of paper for its structure
- It can have other material as electronics one to make it work or interact 

### Input possible
- Time (every hours or once in a day or unexpected times)
- Pulling something hanging

### Output possible
- Getting something out of it (as a piece of paper with something written on it)
- Displaying sheet of paper in the room with sentence or image written on it


I would like to create three potential different robots by using the input and output I wrote. Be careful to keep all the must-have for each robots you imagine, it is the most important thing.

## Answer from the ai

### 1. The Guiding Sage
Purpose: To encourage the user to take specific actions (like reading, meditating, or stretching) by offering them a thoughtful, guided suggestion.

Structure: Paper segments assembled into an accordion shape, which can expand and contract to different lengths, creating a flexible, “floating” arm.
Input: Triggered by a set daily or weekly timer, or by pulling a paper strip hanging down as an interactive switch.

Output:
At the appointed time, the robot extends downward and opens a small, delicate paper pocket containing a piece of paper. This could be a written suggestion or task, like “Read for 10 minutes,” “Stretch your arms and back,” or “Write down a thought.”
The pocket and paper retract slowly after a set amount of time, allowing you to interact briefly but without feeling rushed.
The soft, accordion movement and the fluttering paper create a calming presence that encourages you to follow its gentle suggestion.
This robot acts as a gentle guide, bridging the space between ceiling and floor to bring purposeful suggestions into the daily environment, using motion and paper texture to create a serene, guiding experience.

### 2. The Fortune Drifter
Purpose: A soft, ceiling-mounted "fortune cookie" distributor, this robot releases small, cryptic notes with thoughtful or whimsical messages for you to find throughout the day.

Structure: A delicate, fan-shaped paper structure with pockets that hold small, folded slips of paper. The robot can slide along a ceiling track, positioning itself above different parts of the room.
Input: Randomized timing or daily intervals, dispensing a "fortune" once or twice a day.

Output:
When triggered, the robot releases a folded paper fortune that gently drifts down to the floor. Each fortune is a small mystery or riddle, like “A surprise awaits” or “Look closely, something is hidden.”
Fortunes may contain simple drawings or inspiring words that feel like small gifts, encouraging reflection or wonder.
Interaction with Environment: As it moves to various spots on the ceiling, the robot distributes these fortunes unpredictably, creating a scattered path of fortunes on the floor to collect or read at leisure.
This design adds a playful, almost magical element to the space, like a fortune cookie jar that disperses little mysteries and messages from the ceiling.

### 3. The Curiosity Calendar
Purpose: Acting as a ceiling-mounted advent calendar, this robot releases small surprises daily or weekly, perfect for building anticipation or simply adding a bit of joy.

Structure: Shaped like a paper lantern with segmented layers, each containing a small, folded paper "window." It slides slowly along the ceiling track, presenting different segments on different days.
Input: Set to open at specific times, like every morning or evening, or it could be manually triggered by pulling a decorative paper tassel.
Output:
Each day (or at designated intervals), the robot releases a small paper window that drifts down, revealing a hidden message or mini-puzzle for the day.
Each paper could contain tiny drawings, haikus, jokes, or fun challenges, like “Find something blue today” or “Write one thing you’re grateful for.”
Interaction with Environment: The fallen papers create a mini “trail” of surprises on the floor, which you can collect and display, giving the space a playful ambiance.
This robot is like an endless advent calendar, offering moments of joy and discovery with each small release.

### 4. The Wish Weaver
Purpose: To distribute little "wishes" or positive affirmations, bringing a touch of positivity to everyday life, like a gentle reminder to find magic in ordinary moments.

Structure: An accordion-folded paper structure that fans out as it moves, like a delicate paper feather. It holds several small, lightweight papers, each with a hidden “wish” or affirmation.
Input: Randomly timed throughout the week, or triggered by pulling a dangling paper ribbon to release a wish when desired.

Output:
When activated, the robot gently releases a small paper wish, such as “Believe in your magic,” “Today, notice something beautiful,” or “Be kind to yourself.” Each wish drifts softly to the floor, waiting to be discovered.
The wishes accumulate over time, creating a visual “gathering” of positive affirmations on the floor.
Interaction with Environment: The wishes become part of the room’s décor as they collect on the floor, creating an uplifting, decorative display that you can interact with by rearranging or saving them.
This design turns daily routines into opportunities for optimism and self-care, offering gentle encouragements and thoughtful messages in an elegant, distributive form.
