## Trapping things to reveal presence and passage through time
The idea behind the next prototypes it to create space as a storage tray to allow the deposit pf things.
Those things should be recorded or archived in a way that we can look back and find out how through the time we can kind of read our presence in a place as home.

### Entrance catcher (first test)
First research about footprint at the entrance
The idea here was to find a way to catch the passage in a literal way.

# Printing as a methodology of capturing daily object
To keep a trace of the passage, my idea was to record it as a calendar or memento mori devleoping along the time.
Triggered by the passage of people and working with the light, i thought about cyanotype as a way of printing the footprint.

## What is cyanotype ?

Cyanotype photography is a camera-less technique that involves laying an object on paper coated with a solution of iron salts before exposing it to UV light and washing with water to create stunning white and Prussian blue images.

## How ?

It should work as a procedure quite easy with the cyanotype pre inked being on a paper roll under the elements being exposed when the light can go through and then reveal the objects.

## Example of cyanotype :

# References of storage tray 
Storagetray is the perfect spot to observe the passage and the time passing at a domestic place. Indeed some objects are coming in and coming out as some are getting out

## Real storagetrays

# Scenario

A soft robot made from paper that opens and closes like a flower or clam based on the sunâ€™s cycle.

So it exists a recipient as a spot to put your daily objects as keys/ glasses/ Headphones etc.

This one is open everyday as the sun is out, so it allowed the used to put things before the night (then it close) 

Objects placed inside during the day are imprinted onto cyanotype paper when the robot closes at night using UV light.

Once the imprint is complete, the cyanotype paper is rolled up and stored, and the robot reopens to release the objects.
