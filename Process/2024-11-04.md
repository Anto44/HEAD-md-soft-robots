# SCENARIO FOR THE LIGHT-NET-CAUGHT
I am trying to allow a day by themes I have highlight. For today it will be the idea of the light net caught.

## LIGHT-NET-CAUGHT
A soft robot helping you in habiting your ceiling

### Concept
Working as a decorating area, this soft robot troubles your daily routine through a mechanism displaying itself in the middle of your living room allowing you to hang stuff on it.

### Where does it exist ?
On a ceiling around a bulb 

### For who is it ?
For people who would like to find a way to arrange their ceiling and lazy to buy a lampshades or hide the hole.

### How does it work ?
The net is going down at a random moment of the day, working a bit as a surprise being fixed to the ceiling, you never know when the present will fall down back to you. 

### How does the user interact with the robots ?
When the net going down, it allows the user to hang decoration/ clothing/ words/ images. Being back to the ceiling the objects are deployed into the ceiling
