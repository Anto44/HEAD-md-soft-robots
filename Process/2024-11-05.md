The paper going out is printed delivering message down to the user as pre-printed instruction manual that help you fill the other roll. This other roll going from the ground being filled get in a seal box as a camera roll.

### How does the user interact with the robots ?
Everyday one instruction goes down from the box then you have to write on the other roll your thinking about it or draw something.
