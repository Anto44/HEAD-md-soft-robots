# Summary of the robot 
Ephemeris is a soft, luminescent cocoon that invites users to interact with their thoughts and inspirations in an introspective, tangible way. By extracting fleeting ideas from the mind and transforming them into cyanotypes through the nurturing energy of UV light, it captures the delicate balance between ephemerality and permanence. Inspired by the butterfly’s metamorphosis, Ephemeris fosters a ritual of nightly reflection, where quotes or musings evolve into meaningful mementos of personal growth. Each morning, as the cocoon opens, it reveals an ever-growing archive—volatile yet profound markers of the user’s journey through time. Anchored to a daily timeline, it encourages consistent use, allowing users to chronicle their evolution. This ephemeral archive, tied to the fluxus of daily life, becomes a temporal notebook—a delicate interplay of creativity, introspection, and transformation.

# Asssembling process 

## 3d Modeling for Servo motor

For this part i had to modelize different pieces that couldn't be made out of wood.
I had to do various pieces for the servo motor :

### Allowing the connexion between servo and clam 
Through this piece, I was able to make the sliding for the clams and then open and close the robot

### Hanging tight the robot to the box
Through this piece, I was able to stuck the servo to avoid any movement

## 3d Modeling for uv led 

I also had to develop a piece so I can put the led in a vertical position allowing the light coming top view.
So I had to calculate the perfect angle and then solder it.

## Everything into the robot 

I try to order the cable and everything to fit into the robot.
In this part there is the two servos moto attached to the box and the cable to supply it. There is also the cables to supply the led.

## The rest of the electronics

Not all the electronics goes into the robot. So The arduino and the main supply cable are outside the robot
