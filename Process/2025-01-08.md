So I tried with the robot and it works also but it has to be exposed longer

# Notebook rather than individual sheets

I also decided to bind the sheet together in an idea of keep it as a growing archive rather than just having individual sheets being lost.

# Design of the sheet

For this part I remember of the discussion during testing day where i first i thought about putting prompt in order to indicate or to guide the user

Then with other discussions and thinking I decided to make it simpler so it could be a selfinterpretation for this introspective moment

I decided to put only the date as simple thing to fill and to keep a trace of the date of the sentence/ quote or think.
