# My soft robot as a guiding storage tray

The idea is to find an invitation for people to put their thing into the storage place.
So I looked into how bees are attracted by flower and how we could tranpose this to human. 

How Flowers Guide Bees to Nectar and Enable Pollination
Bees are guided to flowers through a combination of visual, tactile, and olfactory cues designed to lead them directly to the nectar. During this process, bees inadvertently collect and transfer pollen, enabling the plant's reproduction. Here's how it works:

## Visual Signals:

Flowers often have bright colors and patterns that attract bees. Many flowers display nectar guides—specific markings such as lines, dots, or UV patterns—that direct bees toward the nectar at the center of the flower.
The contrast between the outer and inner parts of the flower helps guide bees to land and move toward the reproductive structures.

## Tactile Guidance:

The shape and texture of a flower guide bees physically. For example, tubular flowers funnel the bee towards the nectar.
Some flowers have landing platforms or grooves that help bees orient themselves and access the nectar.
Olfactory Cues:

Bees are highly sensitive to scents. Flowers produce specific fragrances to attract bees from a distance and guide them toward the nectar source.
Reproductive Strategy:

While seeking nectar, the bee brushes against the flower’s 

## Reproductive organs:

Stamens (male parts) deposit pollen onto the bee.
The bee then transfers this pollen to the stigma (female part) of the next flower it visits, achieving fertilization.
Mechanisms in Different Flowers

# How nature can give example of the way it guide insect into the center of a flower :

Here are examples of how various flowers employ distinct mechanisms to guide bees and ensure pollination

1. Dandelion (Taraxacum spp.)
Visual Signals: Bright yellow petals and UV markings act as a strong attractant.
Pollen Access: The flower's open structure makes both nectar and pollen easily accessible, encouraging bees to land and collect resources.
2. Snapdragon (Antirrhinum spp.)
Tactile Entry: Bees must push through the "closed" flower lips to access the nectar inside. This ensures that only heavier pollinators (like bees) can enter, effectively depositing and collecting pollen.
Selective Pollination: This mechanism reduces nectar theft by smaller insects.
3. Foxglove (Digitalis spp.)
Tubular Shape: The tall, tubular flowers create a narrow space, guiding bees directly past the stamens and stigma.
Landing Spots: Inner markings provide visual cues and a surface for the bee to land and climb deeper.
4. Orchid (Ophrys spp.)
Mimicry: Some orchids mimic the appearance or scent of female bees to attract males. While the male attempts to mate, it picks up pollen sacs, which are transferred to the next flower it visits.
Precision Pollen Placement: The structure ensures the pollen is attached to specific parts of the bee's body.
5. Sage (Salvia spp.)
Lever Mechanism: When a bee lands, its weight activates a lever that lowers the stamens onto the bee’s back, depositing pollen. The same mechanism ensures the bee picks up pollen from the flower's stigma.
6. Sunflower (Helianthus spp.)
Mass Appeal: The large, flat surface of a sunflower head is composed of many small flowers. Bees can easily walk across it, collecting nectar and pollen while transferring pollen between individual florets.
7. Morning Glory (Ipomoea spp.)
Spiral Funnel: The trumpet-shaped flowers act as a visual and physical guide. Bees naturally follow the narrowing shape to the nectar, brushing against reproductive structures along the way.

# How can it be applied to human ? :

## Visual Patterns
Contrasting Colors and Central Focus:
Use colors that draw attention, like bright yellows, reds, or oranges for the petal area, combined with a darker or contrasting color in the center (where the items should be placed).
Mimic nectar guides by adding lines or arrows on the petals that point toward the center of the tray.
Radial Patterns:
Incorporate a radial design—lines or gradients starting from the edges and converging toward the center. This creates a "flow" effect that naturally draws the eye inward.

## Texture and Tactile Elements
Textured Center:
Use a smooth or soft texture in the center of the flower tray where items should go, contrasting with rougher or ridged textures on the petals. This tactile differentiation signals the "correct" place for objects.
Guiding Ridges:
Add subtle grooves or channels on the petals that physically "funnel" objects toward the center, mimicking the shape of a tubular flower.
Raised Edges:
Ensure the center is slightly recessed or surrounded by raised petal edges, making it visually and physically clear where items should be placed.

## Colors to Attract Attention
Bright, Nature-Inspired Colors:
Use colors known to draw human attention, such as yellow, red, or green for the petals. These colors evoke the vibrancy of flowers.
Calming Tones in the Center:
Contrast with neutral or soothing colors (e.g., white, beige, or light blue) in the central storage area to subtly "invite" placement of objects.
Dynamic Gradients:
Create a gradient effect on the petals, transitioning from bold at the edges to softer as it approaches the center.

## Signage and Symbolism
Subtle Icons:
Add small, flower-themed icons or universally understood symbols (e.g., an arrow, circle, or a "place here" text) in the center to clarify its function.
Minimalistic Text:
Use words like "Drop Here" or "Center" written in circular paths or radial arrangements to complement the flower shape without overwhelming it.

## Lighting Effects

Illuminated Center:
If the tray is high-tech or used in dim environments, add a light in the center. A gentle glow or pulsing effect can mimic the way some flowers guide bees with brightness and warmth.
UV-Like Highlights:
Incorporate subtle reflective materials that shimmer or change in light, attracting attention like ultraviolet patterns on flowers.

## Interactive Elements (Optional)
Sound or Feedback:
If you’re creating a tech-enabled tray, a gentle chime or vibration when something is placed in the correct spot reinforces the behavior.
Motion or Animation:
Dynamic petals that subtly "open" or shift when an item is correctly placed can add an engaging element.
Example: Designing a Flower-Shaped Storage Tray
Petals: Bright yellow with soft radial grooves leading toward the center.
Center: Smooth, light green or white with a gentle indent to encourage placement.
Patterns: UV-like radial lines pointing inward, subtle text ("Place Here").
Bonus: Add an LED under the center for a glowing effect to signal where to place items.
This combination of visual, tactile, and possibly interactive elements creates a design that feels intuitive, playful, and functional—guiding humans as effectively as flowers guide bees!
