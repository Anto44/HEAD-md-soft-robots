# Discussion with an AI

## Context
I want to create a soft robot with specific interaction that could either way be passive of active one. It has to interact with people therefore the input is human or natural related. 

### Must-have
- It belong to a domestic place as a home
- It can exist only in the middle of a room
- It has to create the jonction between ground and ceiling (verticality and horizontality)
- You can not miss it when you see it
- It has to be made out of paper for its structure
- It can have other material as electronics one to make it work or interact 
- A moment of reflexion for the person interacting with
- It need to promote the idea of accumulation (physical or not)

### Input possible
- Time every minute or 10 minutes
- Writing something on it 
- Putting something on it as an accumulation 
- Clicking a button to activate it

### Output possible
- Getting something out of it (as a piece of paper with something written on it)
- 

I would like to create three potential different robots by using the input and output I wrote. Be careful to keep all the must-have for each robots you imagine, it is the most important thing.
