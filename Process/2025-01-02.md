# Summary of the robot 
This luminescent cocoon transforms nightly reflections into tangible memories, gestating quotes or drawings into a cyanotype through the nurturing energy of UV light. Inspired by the butterfly cycle, it invites an introspective ritual where fleeting thoughts evolve into mementosâ€”volatile yet meaningful markers of personal growth. As the cocoon opens each morning, it reveals a growing archive of messages, deploying wings of reflection that connect the fluxus of daily life with the enduring imprint of creativity.
