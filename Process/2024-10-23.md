# Thoughts of the day
I want to find a way to habit the ceiling with a soft robot, a mechanism that interact with the domestic place, whats under rather it is a static robot or not. It has to be a movement goign from the top to the bottom into the interact as an output. The input can be active or passive.

# Sure enough
- Coming from the ceiling
- Using gravity 
- Joigning ceiling to ground
- If its location is static, it has to be place in the middle of the room

# Main questions
- Does the robot should point somewhere ? 
- Is it indicating something ? 
- Is it highlighting an idea ?
- Is it taking something 
- Is it leaving something ?
- Does it should be telling you something ?
- Is it in the same spot or does it move along the ceiling ?
- Does it need an input to be activated ?
- Does it need to be hidden until the interaction start ?
- Is it a only one time interaction or can it be ?
- Is it made of the paper roll or a big sheet ?
- Is it something invisible or unexpected allowing surprise and so passsive interaction
- - Or is it something visible and expected allowing a response thanks to active interaction

## Simple mechanism allowing up and down movement
### 1. Pulley System
A basic pulley system consists of a rope or cable threaded through one or more wheels (pulleys). By pulling on one end of the rope, the other end moves up or down. This system is commonly used for lifting objects with minimal effort.
### 2. Counterweight System
A counterweight on one side of a pulley or track balances the weight of an object on the other side, allowing for smooth and controlled up and down movement. Common in elevators or theater curtains.
### 3. Sliding Track Mechanism
A sliding track with rollers or wheels allows an object to move up and down along a vertical rail. This is often seen in drawer slides or adjustable light fixtures. The object moves smoothly along the track using rollers or sliders.
### 4. Telescopic Mechanism
Telescopic tubes can extend or collapse vertically, moving up and down as the sections slide within each other. This is often used in camera tripods or extendable poles.
### 5. Rack and Pinion
A gear system where a pinion (gear) moves along a rack (toothed rail), converting rotational movement into vertical linear movement. This can be found in elevating platforms or crane mechanisms.
### 6. Scissor Lift Mechanism
This consists of two sets of crossed arms that form a scissor-like structure. When the arms are pushed together, the platform moves up, and when extended, it moves down. Common in lift tables or hydraulic lifts.
### 7. Chain and Sprocket Mechanism
Similar to a pulley, but using a chain looped around sprockets (gears). Turning the sprocket pulls the chain, causing an object to move up or down. This is used in bicycle mechanisms and conveyor systems.

### 8. Spring-Loaded Reel
A spring-loaded reel (like those found in retractable power cords) automatically pulls an object up when tension is released, and allows it to drop when pulled. Often used in tools or cable management systems.

### 9. Winch Mechanism
A winch uses a crank or motor to wind a rope or cable around a spool, allowing the controlled movement of an object up or down. Common in lifting systems or cranes.

### 10. Gravity-Based Drop Mechanism
An object can be allowed to drop under gravity, with its descent controlled by a brake or friction system, such as those found in window blinds or elevator safety systems.




# Exercises v3

## Question 1
In what kind of situations could my soft robot perform ?

- At an unexpected moment or a precise hours of the day
- When absolutely needed 
- It could help to answer question for something precise 
- It could indicate or highlight an object in the space under it 
- It could create surprise or advertise

## Question 2
Where could my soft robot be placed ?

# Discussion with an AI

## Context
I want to create a soft robot habiting the domestic ceiling, a mechanism that interact the room and whats under it (object). The robot can only going from up and down as it is its only movement (using gravity or not). The input can be active (rope pulled by a person) or passive (starting base on a timeline pre programmed). I have three idea :
- A personal emergency to warn yourself from something
- A unexpected event to trigger you about the routine
- A guiding system to force you to take the time to do something specific
The system can play with what is under it (as an object) or not (poetical)

### Must-have
- It belong to a domestic place as a home (any room)
- It has to be fixed to the ceiling but nothing fixed from the ground
- It has to create the jonction between ground and ceiling (verticality)
- It has to be made out of paper for its structure
- It can have other material as electronics one to make it work or interact 

### Input possible
- Time (every hours or once in a day or unexpected times)
- Pulling something hanging

### Output possible
- Getting something out of it (as a piece of paper with something written on it)
- Going down from the ceiling to indicate something or somewhere
- Going down from the ceiling to give you something to read for example


I would like to create three potential different robots by using the input and output I wrote. Be careful to keep all the must-have for each robots you imagine, it is the most important thing.

# Answer from the AI

## 1. Personal Emergency Reminder Robot
Concept: This robot functions as a personal alert system, designed to remind you of important or urgent tasks, like taking medicine or locking the door.
Input: It is pre-programmed to descend at a specific time (daily or hourly) when you need a reminder. Alternatively, you can pull a small hanging rope to activate it.
Output: When the designated time arrives or the rope is pulled, the robot descends slowly from the ceiling, presenting a piece of paper with a clear, urgent reminder written on it, such as “Take your medication” or “Check the stove.” The vertical movement captures your attention immediately as it occupies the center of the room.
Interaction with Environment: It can descend over objects, like a desk, gently nudging papers or other items to make sure you don’t overlook it. Once the reminder is acknowledged, it retracts back to the ceiling, resetting for the next reminder.

## 2. Unexpected Routine Disruptor Robot
Concept: This robot is designed to disrupt your daily routine by randomly triggering an unexpected event, encouraging mindfulness or breaking monotony.
Input: The robot is programmed to activate at random times of the day, without the need for human input.
Output: At random moments, the robot descends with a thought-provoking message or an unexpected task written on a piece of paper (e.g., “Take 5 minutes to stretch,” “Look out the window and notice something new,” or “Call someone you miss”). Its unpredictable nature keeps your routine fresh and introduces a playful or reflective pause.
Interaction with Environment: It could descend directly into the middle of the room, slowly and silently, hanging above objects like a table or bed. Its unexpected appearance in the vertical space creates a surprising focal point, drawing attention from whatever you're doing.

## 3. Guiding System for Reflection or Tasks
Concept: This robot acts as a guiding companion that nudges you to take time for specific tasks or reflection throughout the day. It doesn’t overwhelm with to-do lists but encourages taking moments for important, often neglected activities.
Input: Either activated at preset times (e.g., once in the morning and once in the evening) or by pulling a rope when you’re ready.
Output: The robot descends from the ceiling with a message or a task (e.g., “Read for 10 minutes,” “Water the plants,” or “Write down something you're grateful for today”). Alternatively, it may carry a small object or card to give to you directly, like a suggestion written on paper.
Interaction with Environment: It hovers close to important objects (a book on the table, a plant that needs watering) to suggest a task through positioning. It guides you to reflect or perform specific actions, creating a moment of mindfulness as it hangs in your vertical space. After you complete the task, it retracts back up to the ceiling.
