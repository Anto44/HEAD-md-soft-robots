# Thoughts of the day
I want to find a way to habit the ceiling with a soft robot, a mechanism that interact with the domestic place, whats under rather it is a static robot or not. It has to be a movement goign from the top to the bottom into the interact as an output. The input can be active or passive.

# Sure enough
- Coming from the ceiling
- Using gravity 
- Joigning ceiling to ground
- If its location is static, it has to be place in the middle of the room

# Main questions
- Does the robot should point somewhere ? 
- Is it indicating something ? 
- Is it highlighting an idea ?
- Is it taking something 
- Is it leaving something ?
- Does it should be telling you something ?
- Is it in the same spot or does it move along the ceiling ?
- Does it need an input to be activated ?
- Does it need to be hidden until the interaction start ?
- Is it a only one time interaction or can it be ?
- Is it made of the paper roll or a big sheet ?
- Is it something invisible or unexpected allowing surprise and so passsive interaction
- - Or is it something visible and expected allowing a response thanks to active interaction

## Suspended Objects that does not need a human action to work

- Humidity-activated misting system – Releases water mist when the room’s humidity reaches a certain level.
- Automatic greenhouse sprinklers – Dispense water based on soil moisture or climate control systems.
- Temperature-activated hanging shade – Lowers automatically when the room gets too hot, blocking sunlight to cool the space.
- Solar-powered ceiling lantern – Absorbs sunlight during the day and automatically illuminates at night.
- Hanging plant with automatic watering system – Waters itself based on sensors detecting moisture levels in the soil.
- Hanging bird feeder with motion detection – Dispenses bird feed when birds approach, without needing human refilling.
- Ceiling-mounted air vents (smart HVAC systems) – Adjust airflow automatically based on room temperature or air quality.
- Light-sensitive hanging art installation – Changes color or movement based on the light levels in the room.
- Suspended climate control units – Automatically adjust heating or cooling based on room temperature or external weather conditions.
- Hanging carbon monoxide or smoke detectors – Automatically activate alarms in response to environmental hazards like gas or smoke.
- Hanging UV light purifier – Reacts to air quality and purifies the air by eliminating bacteria or germs.
- Ceiling-mounted projector with auto-dimming – Adjusts brightness or focus based on ambient light in the room.

## Simple mechanism allowing up and down movement
### 1. Pulley System
A basic pulley system consists of a rope or cable threaded through one or more wheels (pulleys). By pulling on one end of the rope, the other end moves up or down. This system is commonly used for lifting objects with minimal effort.
### 2. Counterweight System
A counterweight on one side of a pulley or track balances the weight of an object on the other side, allowing for smooth and controlled up and down movement. Common in elevators or theater curtains.
### 3. Sliding Track Mechanism
A sliding track with rollers or wheels allows an object to move up and down along a vertical rail. This is often seen in drawer slides or adjustable light fixtures. The object moves smoothly along the track using rollers or sliders.
### 4. Telescopic Mechanism
Telescopic tubes can extend or collapse vertically, moving up and down as the sections slide within each other. This is often used in camera tripods or extendable poles.
### 5. Rack and Pinion
A gear system where a pinion (gear) moves along a rack (toothed rail), converting rotational movement into vertical linear movement. This can be found in elevating platforms or crane mechanisms.
### 6. Scissor Lift Mechanism
This consists of two sets of crossed arms that form a scissor-like structure. When the arms are pushed together, the platform moves up, and when extended, it moves down. Common in lift tables or hydraulic lifts.
### 7. Chain and Sprocket Mechanism
Similar to a pulley, but using a chain looped around sprockets (gears). Turning the sprocket pulls the chain, causing an object to move up or down. This is used in bicycle mechanisms and conveyor systems.

### 8. Spring-Loaded Reel
A spring-loaded reel (like those found in retractable power cords) automatically pulls an object up when tension is released, and allows it to drop when pulled. Often used in tools or cable management systems.

### 9. Winch Mechanism
A winch uses a crank or motor to wind a rope or cable around a spool, allowing the controlled movement of an object up or down. Common in lifting systems or cranes.

### 10. Gravity-Based Drop Mechanism
An object can be allowed to drop under gravity, with its descent controlled by a brake or friction system, such as those found in window blinds or elevator safety systems.




# Exercises v3

## Question 1
In what kind of situations could my soft robot perform ?

- At an unexpected moment or a precise hours of the day
- When absolutely needed 
- It could help to answer question for something precise 
- It could indicate or highlight an object in the space under it 
- It could create surprise or advertise

## Question 2
Where could my soft robot be placed ?
- Hanging from the ceiling
- In the middle of a room (if static)
- Could be above an object
- Anywhere on the ceiling (if moving)1

## Question 3
How would it interact ?
- By delivering something needed by the person
- By forcing the person to do something
- By interrupting time passing by 
- It could interact with the time without someone to interact with

## Question 4
What would be the input ? 
- Nothing but time (every hours, everyday same hour)
- Not enough stimulated
- By pulling a part of the robots (like a rope/ emergency handle)

## Question 5
What would be the output ?
- Enlighting "something" (direction/ light/ word)
- A moment of reflexion
- A movement as pointing a direction
- A word or a sentence (appaearing/ constantly updating ?)
- Shaking lightly or strongly depending of the intensity of the input

# Discussion with an AI

## Context
I want to create a soft robot habiting the domestic ceiling, a mechanism that interact the room and whats under it (object). The robot can only going from up and down as it is its only movement (using gravity or not). The input can be active (rope pulled by a person) or passive (starting base on a timeline pre programmed). I have three idea :
- A personal emergency to warn yourself from something
- A unexpected event to trigger you about the routine
- A guiding system to force you to take the time to do something specific
The system can play with what is under it (as an object) or not (poetical)

### Must-have
- It belong to a domestic place as a home (any room)
- It can exist only in the middle of a room
- It has to create the jonction between ground and ceiling (verticality)
- You can not miss it when you see it
- It has to be made out of paper for its structure
- It can have other material as electronics one to make it work or interact 
- A kind of reminder or to do an action for the person to see it

### Input possible
- Time (once in a day)
- Putting something on it as an accumulation (under the robot)

### Output possible
- Getting something out of it (as a piece of paper with something written on it)
- Going down from the ceiling to indicate something to do
- Taking out something from the person interacting with

I would like to create three potential different robots by using the input and output I wrote. Be careful to keep all the must-have for each robots you imagine, it is the most important thing.
