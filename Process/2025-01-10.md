EPHEMERIS, An evanescent record

## Final Summary of the robot 
Ephemeris is a soft, luminescent cocoon that invites users to interact with their thoughts and inspirations in an introspective, tangible way. By extracting fleeting ideas from the mind and transforming them into cyanotypes through the nurturing energy of UV light, it captures the delicate balance between ephemerality and permanence. Inspired by the butterfly’s metamorphosis, Ephemeris fosters a ritual of nightly reflection, where quotes, draws or musings evolve into meaningful mementos of personal growth. 

Each morning, as the cocoon opens, it reveals an ever-growing archive—volatile yet profound markers of the user’s journey through time. Anchored to a daily timeline, it encourages consistent use, allowing users to chronicle their evolution. This ephemeral archive, tied to the fluxus of daily life, becomes a temporal notebook—a delicate interplay of creativity, introspection, and transformation.

## Final scenario
As the sun sets, the robot opens, inviting the user to reflect on their day. A thought, event, or quote is inscribed and entrusted to the robot before sleep. Overnight, it transforms the message into a tangible imprint on paper. By morning, the robot reopens, revealing the preserved creation, a ritual that anchors fleeting reflections into meaningful mementos.
