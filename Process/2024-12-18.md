# TESTING DAY 

For this testing day, it was really interesting to get those feedback based on the object alone and how it can be apprehended withouth any explanations.

After the day I realize that this object would keep this idea of milestone but maybe in a more active way as a spot to archive in an ephemeral way. 

I decided to allow the user to write or draw on the robot in order to create a precious message to himself as the cyanotype represent time and reflexion on things 

The user can for example extract sentence from book to take it with him/her. With the time passing, the sentence will fade away because of the light.


# Keypoints of discussion

## Some key points based on the testing :

- Creating prompt to make it more appealing
- Hanged on the wall as a way of feeding the wall
- Indicated for one person only as an introspection moment
- Pre print the paper as a way of creating a composition
- Targeting a niche of people as a specific domain
- Creating a narration through the different sheets
- Better to avoid the date on it 
- Evolution and maturation as the main guide 
- Scratching the sheet in order to create a square so it can become a mosaic
- Using thin paper but no sticker becaue it becomes an object
- Maybe the prompt is just symbols or wrond words
- A robot looking not so utopistic not so dystopic
- How to keep the user using it daily
- creating a symbiotic between the robot and the person
