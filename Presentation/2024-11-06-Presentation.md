## Area of intervention
My project focus on the concept of creating a perched soft robot acting as a witness catching traces of your life by archiving them as a time capsule

## Research Question
What do we left behind us ? Traces are left, where and how archiving them ?
How to habitate the ceiling as a witness space of what is under ?

## Research
Through my research I focus on three main things :

### 1. Time avaibility

I firstly think about my bookshelf being a representation of the time I dont have to read the book I bought

Leading me to ask myself few questions about it :

### 2. Physical traces

Looked about the traces I leave behind myself as a disruptive decoration.

Something impacting my domestic space as a representation or a souvenirs of my behaviour or presence. An idea of recording my passage as a souvenir or archive.

### 2. Filling space

Through this idea of space I observe my passage and the way I move in my flat as. Living a blank being the middle of my living room.
This remind me this idea of scarecrows being in the middle of a field.

Through this idea of verticality with space around I kept asking myself about the space above me. A ceiling being an available space but oftenly empty.
All those bulb or hole in this inhabitated area.

Those question lead me to these following keywords :

- Verticality/ horizontality
- Archiving/ recording
- Catching things
- Habitate empty space
- Ceiling as a limit (height)
- Surveillance/ witness
- Time based interaction
- Ungravity

## Insights
 There is always traces of our passage everywhere

 We specifically repeat everyday our habits in our domestic place
 
 We never really think about using the ceiling as a disposal space

## Three prototypes

### 1.The light catcher
A soft robot helping filling your ceiling

#### Summary
Working as a life-things catcher, this soft robot display itself everyday in the middle of your living room allowing you to hang stuff on it.

#### How does it work ?
The net is going down at a random moment of the day, working a bit as a surprise drop. When the net is down you are allowed to stick things to it as words/sentence/draw. It will then get back to its 2D nature acting as a collection of what you feed it.
By being fixed to the ceiling, you never know when the present will fall down back to you.

### 2.The Reverse reminder
A soft robot working as a time-capsule creator

#### Summary
This soft robot allows you to  to record things of the life as a time capsule tool creator.
This robot could be perched to a wall or on a table and will be used by people who wants to record a trace of their life.

#### How does it work ?
The paper going out is delivering message trhough a screen down to the user as pre-printed instruction manual. That indicates you how to fill the other roll (blue). Following those instruction the user fill the blue roll and get sealed by the end in a box.

### 3.MEMENTO MORI CALENDAR
A soft robot performing the time passing

#### Summary
Working as a clock of life, this robot sporead a roll of paper going from the ceiling to the groundfloor. As a metaphor of the death coming this robot warn the user of the time passing with some indication during the process of time flying. 

#### How does it work ?
The paper going out is printed delivering message down to the user as the time or any memories of the past through sentence and images.

### How does it work ?

## Next Steps
I would like to push the idea of the system for catching things from the ceiling.
